GIT:
to clone repository: git clone "content from the clipboard on the website"
to know the status:  git status
to add to the master file:  git add "filename"
to commit changes:  git commit -m "Added section describing how to build project"
to create a local branch and switch to it:  git checkout -b feature1
to create a text file:  touch feature1.txt
to extract file and want that file to be managed by git:  git add feature1.txt
to push local branch to remote repository for the first time:  git push -u origin feature1
to point to the master branch:  git checkout master
to ensure that master branch has all the current changes from the remote repository:  git pull
to merge:  git merge feature1
to push local master to remote master:  git push

GIT-gitflow_workflow:
to create main development code-line: git checkout -b develop
to make available this repository remotely:   git push -u origin develop
to make another feature branch: git checkout -b feature2
follow the same set of commands from making  a .txt file tog push it.
to integrate feature2 with the main command line i.e. develop:
1)git checkout develop
2)git pull
3)git merge feature2
4)git push
now all the release code is present in our release repository i.e. develop
and we want to integrate it with the dedicated master branch
1)git checkout master
2)git pull
3)git merge develop
4)git push
5)git tag "1.0.0.RELEASE" -m "Releasing version 1.0.0"
6)git push --tags
tag is the special branch which can be set up to be read-only giving us the certainty
to always go back to the branch in order to use releasable code.
